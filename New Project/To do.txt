To Do:
1.	Scroll bar, split in  5-year chunks. ~ done
	Leaving as one year increments for accuracy and not too power intensive.
2.	Data for sea level, temperature, CO2, from ~1985 up to current day. ~ done
3.	Change the globe to more graphs. ~ done
	Having both, main focus on world map
4.	Adjust scroll bar more pointer style. ~ done
5.  Mouse hovering over countries to show detail in information box.
6.  Have a circle which adjusts to the size of the emissions.
7.  Use colours to represent the intensity.
8.	Add graphs to go into the right-hand side boxes. ~ done
9.	Lock the form to one size. Intended for desktop use (as desided by my end user) therefore it dosent need rescsaling.
	Posible next step to improve the form would be to rescale the form.
10.	Tooltips for graph.
